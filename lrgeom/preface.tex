This is my personal script for the lecture Riemannian and Lorentzian Geometry in the winter term of 25/26 at the University of Hamburg. The script mostly follows the lecture of \href{https://grafmelanie.wordpress.com/}{Prof. Dr. Melanie Graf} with occasional bits adapted form the avaliable literature. The layout is a personal adaption of \href{https://castel.dev/}{Gilles Casel's} layout. We will adapt most notations from \ref{LeeSM} and \ref{LeeRM} and use the Einstein summation convention throughout.
The lecture first aims to fill some gaps often left in undergraduate differential geometry lectures, mainly the theorem of Hopf and Rinow. After that, we continue with some notions inherent to Lorentzian geometry before focussing our attention again on the (semi-)Riemannian case. Later, we will use Jacobi fields and do some comparison geometry.
